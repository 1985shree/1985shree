### Welcome to my github page! ðŸ‘‹

I am a scientist and also a data scientist with a huge interest in finding innovative solutions to everyday problems. After a 6-month data science course at Le Wagon, where I learnt to implement industry best practices and skills, I'm ready to take on roles as data scientist/data engineer. Almost a decade of experience as a scientist and more than a year's training in coding and machine learning has prepared me on this journey. As part of my job, I have been using Python packages for 4+ years for laboratory data analysis and my personal projects. I finished a team project on event recommendation in collaboation with a web-development team. Now I am actively looking for a position in industries (ideally in pharmaceutical, chemical , MedTech, Finance or sustainability sector).

Things I'm doing at present in addition to my regular research work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NLP and recommendation system.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data engineering and MongoDB.


- Libraries and tools: NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Methodologies: Statistical methods: Bootstrapping, Hypothesis testing; ML methods: Classification, Linear and multivariate regression, deep learning,     pipelines, parameter tuning.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML projects on healthcare, business and climate.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding in-depth the working and performance of models, infrastructure building and front-end.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Spectroscopy, Data processing, Data visualization
