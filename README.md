### Welcome to my github page! ðŸ‘‹

I am a scientist with a PhD in Physical Chemistry and a passion in machine learning and automation. I have experience in programming, data analytics, spectroscopic methods, and interpretation of the data with various models. I am enthusiastic about ML/DL and their application in science, business and healthcare. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Deaprtment of Experimental Physics at the Freie Uniersity, Berlin. 

Things I'm doing at present in addition to my regular research work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NLP and recommendation system.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data engineering and MLOps engineering.


- Libraries and tools: NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Methodologies: Statistical methods: Bootstrapping, Hypothesis testing; ML methods: Classification, Linear and multivariate regression, deep learning,     pipelines, parameter tuning.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML projects on healthcare, business and climate.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding in-depth the working and performance of models, infrastructure building and front-end.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Spectroscopy, Data processing, Data visualization
