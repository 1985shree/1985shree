### Welcome to my github page! ðŸ‘‹

I am a scientist with a PhD in Physical Chemistry. I have experience in different spectroscopic methods, data processing and interpretation of the data with various models. I am enthusiastic about machine learning models and their application in science, business and healthcare. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Deaprtment of Experimental Physics at the Freie Uniersity, Berlin. My domain expertise is ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy. 

Things I'm doing at present:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Statistical and machine learning models.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML methods and their capabilities with Scikit-Learn.
- 
- Programming Language: Python,  SQL, FORTRAN
- 
- Libraries and tools: NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 
- Methodologies Statistical methods: Bootstrapping, Hypothesis testing. ML methods: Classification, Linear and multivariate regression, Parameter tuning
- 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML projects on healthcare, business and spectroscopy.
- 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding in depth the working and performance of models.
