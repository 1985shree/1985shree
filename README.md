### Welcome to my github page! ðŸ‘‹

I am a scientist-turned-data scientist with a huge interest in finding innovative solutions to everyday problems. I've been using python and SQL to build my data science projects since 2020. A 6-month data science course at Le Wagon helped me to learn and implement industry best practices and skills. Almost a decade of experience as a scientist and more than 3 year's training in coding and machine learning has prepared me on this journey. I love to do team projects and also contribute to 'AI For good' projects, which have positive impact on society and environment. I am looking forward to build my career in sustainable, social and climate-responsible financial projects and risk managements with my ever expanding data science and statistics toolbox. 

Things I've done in the past in addition to my regular work in building machine-lerarning models to tackle money-laundering with our client bank:

- ðŸ”­ worked on NLP and recommendation system (cosine similarity, knn) with vectorizers, transformers and LLMs as well.

- ðŸŒ± worked in MLOps (MLflow for ML lifecycle management, GCP and AWS for storage, running models and deployment throug APIs etc.)

- worked in original reserach projects in molecular physics and published results in leading international journals. My science research background spans over 10 years and I have worked on complex (and cool) projects like femtosecond (i.e. 1/1000000000000000000 th of a second) stimulated Raman spectroscopy, laser induced fluorescence of ultra-cooled molecules at 3-4 K etc.

- Libraries and tools: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Spacy, LLMs, Pinecone.

- Methodologies: Statistical methods: Bootstrapping, Hypothesis testing; ML methods: Classification, Linear and multivariate regression, deep learning, tee based models, pipelines, Grid/random search CV.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML projects on healthcare, business and climate.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding in-depth the working and performance metrics, infrastructure building and front-end dev.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Spectroscopy, Data processing, Data visualization, ML
